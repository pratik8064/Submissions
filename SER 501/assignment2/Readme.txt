In code I have commented the driver calls in test() function . It has sample inputs. 
The only flake8 warning that I got is on line 7 due to given input being large. 
I have not modified the given input, hence warning persists in all screenshots

I have also changed first line 

from numpy import*
to
from numpy import array
from numpy import asarray

since we only needed array and asarray
